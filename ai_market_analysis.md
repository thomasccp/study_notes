# Applications:
1. Image recognition
2. Voice recognition

# Markets:
1. Mobile phone and tablets
- Photo editing, AR, voice assistance
- Android NN -> TensorFlow/TensorFlow Lite
- **Cost/mm^2**? 2017 28nm is $0.08/mm^2, ie. 4G quad core 50mm^2 costs $4; 4G 8 core 100mm^2 costs $8
- **Performance/W**? Big core: 10-100Gops/W (INT8); Small core: 100G-1Tops/W; GPU: 300Gops/W; Custom deep learning accelerator: 1Tops/W+?
- **Compute power**? Total system power < 2.5W, how much for deep learning? 1.5W? -> 1T/W means 1.5T
- CPU is okay for intermedittent compute such as voice recognition
- GPU/accelerator is needed for continuous compute such as AR
